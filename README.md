# HandWrittenDigitRecognitionUsingNN

A single file name : HandWrittenDigitPredictionUsingNN.m contains all the relavant functions to compute the cost and Gradient which can predict the hand written digit of 20x20 pixel.
just copy paste the entire code into Matlab/octave working space and run the programe

Note: 

1. Training set file should be availble in the same directory (i.e working directory)

2. if Advanced optimisation algorithm Fmincg is used to computed the Parameters then fmincgfile should also be present in working directory

3. It does not contain the Gradient chacking code yet. it is still under construction. It will get updated once finished 

4. Two hand written images are also added to verify whether algortihm is working fine or not. you can use them to test the Algorithm.

5. The code to check the new images is also included at the bottom of the file. make sure imgaes are also present in working directory
